This challenge involves playing a game against the remote server, with 42 rounds. In each round:
 - We send $$n$$, a composite of two large primes, $$p$$ and $$q$$.
 - The server generates a random integer $$r \in [0, n]$$, It then finds $$s = r^2 \mod n$$ and sends us $$s$$.
 - We must send a value for $$r$$, which we'll call $$r_g$$, to the server. The server validates that $$r_g$$ is indeed a root of $$s$$.
 - The server calculates $$gcd(\lvert r-r_g \rvert, n)$$.
     - If it is able to factorise $$n$$ into the primes $$p$$ and $$q$$, the server wins.
     - If it is unable to calculate the primes, we win.
 - Finally, we send the primes $$p$$ and $$q$$ to the server, and it checks that they are valid 512-bit or more primes using a variant of the [Miller-Rabin primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test).

```python
for i in range(games):
    while True:
        n = int(raw_input("Give me a fresh composite n=p*q\n> "))
        for p in seen_p:
            if n % p == 0:
                print "I already know a prime factor! Use a different n: ", p
                break
        else:
            break

    r = R.randint(0, n)
    s = r*r % n
    print "Alrighty, now please give me the root of\n%d" % s
    ans = int(raw_input("> "))
    if (ans * ans) % n != s:
        print "This is wrong. I wont play with cheaters. Bye!"
        sys.exit()

    p = gcd(n, (r-ans) % n)
    q = n / p

    if p>1 and q>1:
        print "RESULT: I won! Here are your factors: ", p, q
    else:
        print "RESULT: Hrmpf you win."
        wins += 1
```

This is essentially a [Rabin cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_cryptosystem), which is like a simplified form of [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)), using $$e=2$$ and the factorisation of $$n = p \times q$$ directly as the private key. Rabin, unlike RSA, has been proven to be as hard to solve as integer factorisation, however it has several practical difficulties which has contributed to its lack of popularity compared to RSA.

The largest of these practical difficulties is exploited in this challenge. Because decrypting a Rabin ciphertext is just finding its modular square root (which is of course easy if you know the factorisation of the modulus $$n$$) there are actually four roots/possible plaintexts which could produce each ciphertext.

While one of these roots is the original plaintext, the other three are garbage, and they open the door to a dangerous attack. The roots may be divided into two sets, $$(r_0, r_1)$$, $$(r_2, r_3)$$. If you know a root from each of the sets, you can trivially figure out the factorisation of $$n$$. For some reason this issue isn't described in the most recent version of the Wikipedia article, so [here is a link](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rabin_cryptosystem&oldid=604553404#Decryption) to an older revision, and it's also noted in Rabin's [original paper](http://publications.csail.mit.edu/lcs/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-212.pdf).

When the server sends us $$s$$ and we have to send back $$r_g$$, there is a 50% chance that $$r_g$$ will be in a different set to the $$r$$ that the server selected, and thus a 50% chance that $$gcd(\lvert r-r_g \rvert, n)$$ will successfully give the server $$p$$ and $$q$$. So it will win roughly 50% of the time.

But to win the easy flag, we have to win over 90% of the time, and to win the hard flag, less than 10% of the time.

An idea we had was to set $$p = q$$ when generating $$n$$. This essentially breaks the Rabin cryptosystem, which relies on the isomorphism between $$\mathbf{Z}_{pq}$$ and $$\mathbf{Z}_{p} \times \mathbf{Z}_{q}$$, which only holds when $$p \ne q$$. Then, while we can still calculate the root $$r$$ using a different method, the server's method for calculating $$p$$ will no longer work, as there are no longer four roots.

We can use the [Tonelli-Shanks algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm) to solve the square root of $$s$$ modulo the prime $$p$$:

$$r^2 \equiv s \mod p$$

And then use [Hensel's lifting lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hensel's_lemma) to "lift" this solution to a higher power of $$p$$:

$$r^2 \equiv s \mod p^2$$

Which is the same as finding the square root of $$s \mod n$$, and allows us to win against the server every time.

## Prejudiced Randomness 2

Unfortunately we weren't able to figure out how to get the hard flag. We would love to see a writeup for it.


## Power

> RSA is too boring. Raise to the power of x instead.

After calculating large prime $$p$$, we have to find $$x$$ such that:

$$a \equiv x^x \mod p$$

Where $$a$$ is a challenge $$a \in [1, p-1]$$.

The maths are explained in this [excellent writeup](https://github.com/wonrzrzeczny/CTF-writeups/blob/master/Chaos%20Communication%20Camp%202019%20CTF/Power/readme.md), here is our implementation:

```python
from pwn import *
from fractions import gcd

def chinese_remainder(n, a):
    sum = 0
    prod = reduce(lambda a, b: a*b, n)
 
    for n_i, a_i in zip(n, a):
        p = prod / n_i
        sum += a_i * mul_inv(p, n_i) * p
    return sum % prod
 
 
def mul_inv(a, b):
    b0 = b
    x0, x1 = 0, 1
    if b == 1: return 1
    while a > 1:
        q = a / b
        a, b = b, a%b
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    if x1 < 0: x1 += b0
    return x1
 

def get_resp(base):
    line = r.recvline()
    print(line)
    chal = line.split()[1]
    print(r.recvuntil(': '))
    r.sendline(str(base))
    line = r.recvline()
    resp = line.split()[1]

    return int(chal), int(resp)

r = remote('hax.allesctf.net', 1337)

N1 = 142
N2 = 143 # first x which wraps the modulus

chal1, resp1 = get_resp(N1)
chal2, resp2 = get_resp(N2)
d1 = N1 ** N1 - resp1
d2 = N2 ** N2 - resp2

p = gcd(d1,d2)
print("modulus: %s" % p)


line = r.recvline()
print(line)
chal = int(line.split()[1])
print(r.recvuntil(': '))

n = [p, p-1]
a = [chal, 1]

ans = chinese_remainder(n, a)

r.sendline(str(ans))
line = r.recvline()
print(line)
line = r.recvline()
print(line)

r.close()
```
